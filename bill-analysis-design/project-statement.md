**Project Statement:**

**Title:** Legislative Bias Monitoring and Early-Stage Intervention

**Objective:**
To develop a two-tier system for detecting, scoring, and reporting potential bias within legislative bills while also highlighting their positive impacts. This system will:
1. **Preliminarily assess** bills using their summaries/descriptions to identify and highlight potential discriminatory language or disproportionate impact on protected groups, as well as potential positive impacts.
2. **Conduct a comprehensive final analysis** of the complete, finalized bill text for deeper validation, refined scoring, and actionable feedback.

### **Scope of Work**

1. **Bill Acquisition**  
   - Integrate with LegiScan (or a similar legislative data source) to retrieve metadata for each bill, including:
     - Bill ID  
     - Status (e.g., passed, in progress)  
     - Analysis date

2. **Preliminary Screening**  
   - Employ an LLM (e.g., “MiniMax Text 01”) with a large context window to process summaries/descriptions in batches.
   - Generate **Preliminary Bias Scores** (0–5) and **Preliminary Positive Impact Scores** (0–5) across key categories (e.g., race, religion, gender identity, age, nationality, sexual orientation, disability, veteran status).
   - Use **subgroup codes** (e.g., `BH` for Black/African American, `AP` for Asian/Pacific Islander) for clarity and consistency in analysis.
   - Provide short justifications and references to the triggering language in the summary or metadata.

3. **In-Depth Final Analysis**  
   - For bills that pass (or reach a final draft stage), retrieve the comprehensive PDF/HTML text.
   - Re-run a **deep analysis** using the same LLM to generate detailed bias and positive impact assessments, citing relevant legislative clauses or sections.
   - Compare final scores against preliminary assessments to note any improvements, changes, or new issues arising from amendments.

4. **Subgroup-Level Analysis**  
   - Within each protected category, evaluate potential impacts on **specific subgroups** (e.g., Black/African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, transgender individuals, individuals with physical disabilities, etc.) using their codes.
   - Assign separate **bias** and **positive impact scores** for each subgroup, ensuring that nuanced intra-category effects are captured.
   - Identify disparities in benefits or harms across subgroups, with recommendations for addressing these gaps.

5. **Reporting and Stakeholder Engagement**  
   - Present **actionable insights** to lawmakers, advocacy groups, or policy analysts, highlighting flagged concerns and significant positive impacts.
   - Provide tailored recommendations to mitigate bias and amplify benefits, ensuring equitable legislative outcomes.
   - Share updated analyses as bills evolve, enabling stakeholders to refine provisions proactively.

6. **Data Handling and Record-Keeping**  
   - Store preliminary and final scores alongside each bill’s metadata in a structured format (e.g., JSON or database records).
   - Log changes in bill language and how they affect subgroup-level impacts to enable longitudinal tracking of legislative improvements.

### **Methodology Overview**

1. **LLM Prompt Engineering**
   - Use a standardized prompt that clearly instructs the LLM to:
     - Detect references to protected groups and subgroups using subgroup codes.
     - Score both bias and positive impacts.
     - Provide textual evidence and confidence levels.
   - Ensure consistency in prompts across preliminary and final analyses.

2. **Evaluation and Thresholds**
   - A threshold-based system triggers review when a bill’s **bias score** exceeds a pre-defined concern level (e.g., 3/5 or higher).
   - Similarly, flag bills with high **positive impact scores** (e.g., 4/5 or higher) to promote support and advocacy.

3. **Subgroup-Level Nuance**
   - Incorporate subgroup analysis selectively, focusing on cases where intra-category disparities are likely (e.g., racial subgroups, disability types).
   - Use structured data outputs to clearly delineate subgroup findings and their implications.

4. **Iterative Feedback**
   - Incorporate stakeholder input and real-world examples to improve scoring algorithms, category definitions, and prompt clarity over time.
   - Update protected group definitions and subgroup classifications to reflect evolving societal norms and priorities.

### **Anticipated Outcomes**

- **Influence on Legislative Drafting:** Early detection and detailed analysis can prompt lawmakers to adjust problematic language and provisions before finalizing bills.
- **Balanced Reporting:** Highlighting both potential biases and positive impacts ensures comprehensive and fair assessments of legislation.
- **Transparent Tracking:** A publicly accessible or internally shared repository where each bill’s bias and positive impact metrics are logged and tracked.
- **Equity-Driven Insights:** Subgroup-level analysis ensures that systemic inequities within categories are addressed, fostering more inclusive policymaking.

### **Constraints and Considerations**

1. **Incomplete Information:** Bill summaries may omit crucial details, leading to possible underestimation of bias or positive impacts. Final text analysis mitigates this.
2. **Model Limitations:** Large language models can produce inaccuracies or hallucinations. Validation processes and confidence levels mitigate these risks.
3. **Complexity of Subgroup Analysis:** While subgroup-level insights add depth, they also increase system complexity. Selective implementation ensures scalability and relevance.
4. **Continuous Legislative Updates:** Bills can undergo multiple revisions or amendments, necessitating repeated analyses and robust version control.

### **Confidence Score**

Overall confidence in the **project feasibility** and **methodological soundness**: **9/10**

- *Rationale*: This approach leverages structured LLM prompts, subgroup-level nuance, and a two-tier analysis process to ensure robust and actionable outputs. Potential improvements include stakeholder feedback loops and iterative model refinement.
