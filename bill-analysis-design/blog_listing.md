We are now going to work on the Admin Blog listing to:

(1) A paginated llist of blog posts
(2) Should be able to update a blog post (reuse the create form, or change the route name from create to something else)
(3) Can sort by blog id, title, published date, Author, 
(4) Should provide a action to unpublish or publish a post
(5) Have a CTA to create a post
(6) Filter by status and text search by title description .  May need a migration script to use trigram search but we can keep it simple and use LIKE for now
(7) Have a button to view the post on the frontend
