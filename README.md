### Demographic Impact Scoring
Our analysis system evaluates bills across two main dimensions:

1. **Category Level Analysis**
   - Bills are analyzed within broad categories (e.g., Race, Religion, Gender, Age, Disability, Veterans)
   - Each category receives an overall impact score based on aggregated subgroup analysis
   - Scores indicate whether the bill has a positive impact or potential bias

2. **Demographic Subgroup Analysis**
   - Detailed analysis of impact on specific subgroups within each category
   - Each subgroup receives individual scores for:
     - Positive Impact (0-100%): Measures beneficial effects
     - Bias Score (0-100%): Identifies potential negative impacts
   - Neutral scoring when impact is minimal or balanced
