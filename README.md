# Legislative Equity Monitor

A web application that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze the racial equity impact of legislative bills. The system uses AI to process bill text and identify potential impacts on different racial and ethnic communities, providing data-driven insights into legislative effects.

## Features

- AI-powered bill analysis using OpenAI's GPT models
- Automated racial equity impact assessment
- Impact severity classification (mild to urgent)
- Sentiment analysis (positive/negative impacts)
- Interactive dashboard with filtering capabilities
- Detailed bill analysis with sponsor information and voting records
- Impact severity indicators for different demographic groups

## Analysis Approach

The system employs Large Language Models to:
1. Process and understand legislative bill text
2. Analyze potential impacts on different racial and ethnic communities
3. Classify the severity and type of impact for each demographic group
4. Generate detailed explanations of identified impacts
5. Provide evidence-based reasoning for impact assessments
