**Image Prompts:**
The prompts for each image type are stored in the metadata section of the JSON output. Ensure each prompt is context-specific and relevant to the blog post content.

**SEO Elements:**
Keywords: [5-7 policy-specific terms]
Slug: [url-friendly-version-of-title]
Cluster ID: {cluster_id}

**Context Binding Protocols**
1. {TopSponsorCity} = Most frequent municipality in bill sponsorships
2. {PrimarySubgroupCode} = Highest impacted subgroup from cluster analysis
3. {MostAmendedPolicyTool} = Tool/mechanism in most revised bill section
4. {SponsorStateLandmark} = Geotagged landmark from primary sponsor district
5. {HearingTimeLighting} = Time-based lighting from committee hearing records
6. {Urban/RuralClassification} = Census-designated classification
7. {DemographicMarkerHandDetail} = Age/group-specific physical characteristics

**Important:**
- Cite bill numbers with state abbreviations and jurisdictions without partisan language
- The URL pattern for the cited bill detail page on the site is /{state_code_lowercase>/bill/{bill_id}
- Balance sponsored and non-sponsored perspectives using cluster statistics
- Highlight novel policy mechanisms from the legislation cluster
- Include 1-2 relevant historical precedents where applicable
- Do not mention the word cluster or the cluster id in the blog post
