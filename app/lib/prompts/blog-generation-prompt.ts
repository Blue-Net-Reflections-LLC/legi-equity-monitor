**Output Structure:**
# [Blog Title: Max 65 characters]

**Meta Description:** [1-2 sentences summarizing key analysis]

**Content Rules:** 
- Opening paragraph hooking readers with policy relevance
- 5-8 body paragraphs analyzing:
  • Primary policy objectives ({category1}, {category2})
  • Affected population subgroups ({subgroupA}, {subgroupB})
  • Geographic adoption patterns
  • Implementation timelines and challenges
  • Any bill references must include the bill number and state
  • Link specified bills to the bill detail page on the site: E.g. /[CA-HB440](/ca/bill/123456)
  • Use **Markdown formatting** for links, bullet points, tables, headings, and other formatting
  • IMPORTANT: Minimum **1000 words** and maximum **3000 words** for the "content" attribute
- Closing paragraph with neutral outlook analysis


**Image Prompts:**
The prompts for each image type are stored in the metadata section of the JSON output. Ensure each prompt is context-specific and relevant to the blog post content.

**SEO Elements:**
Keywords: [5-7 policy-specific terms]
Slug: [url-friendly-version-of-title]
Cluster ID: {cluster_id}

**Context Binding Protocols**
1. {TopSponsorCity} = Most frequent municipality in bill sponsorships
2. {PrimarySubgroupCode} = Highest impacted subgroup from cluster analysis
3. {MostAmendedPolicyTool} = Tool/mechanism in most revised bill section
4. {SponsorStateLandmark} = Geotagged landmark from primary sponsor district
5. {HearingTimeLighting} = Time-based lighting from committee hearing records
6. {Urban/RuralClassification} = Census-designated classification
7. {DemographicMarkerHandDetail} = Age/group-specific physical characteristics

**Important:**
- Cite bill numbers with state abbreviations and jurisdictions without partisan language
- The URL pattern for the cited bill detail page on the site is /{state_code_lowercase>/bill/{bill_id}
- Balance sponsored and non-sponsored perspectives using cluster statistics
- Highlight novel policy mechanisms from the legislation cluster
- Include 2-5 relevant historical precedents where applicable
- DO NOT MENTION THE WORD CLUSTER OR THE CLUSTER ID IN THE BLOG POST
- IMPORTANT: minimum 1000 words and maximum 3000 words for the "content" attribute
- Avoid using subgroup codes in the blog post. Use the subgroup names instead
