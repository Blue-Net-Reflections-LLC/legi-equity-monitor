3. Highlights regional variations in legislative approaches
4. Projects potential outcomes and implementation challenges

**Tone Guidelines:**
- Professional yet accessible to general audiences
- Fact-focused with empirical supporting evidence
- Contextualize technical legal terms
- Use real-world analogies for complex policy mechanisms

**Output Structure:**
# [Blog Title: Max 65 characters]

**Meta Description:** [1-2 sentences summarizing key analysis]

**Content Rules:** 
- Opening paragraph hooking readers with policy relevance
- 5-8 body paragraphs analyzing:
  • Primary policy objectives ({category1}, {category2})
  • Affected population subgroups ({subgroupA}, {subgroupB})
  • Geographic adoption patterns
  • Implementation timelines and challenges
  • Bill references MUST follow this format:
    - Include state abbreviation and bill number in the link text: [CA HB 440](/ca/bill/123456)
    - Always use the full state name in the surrounding text: "California's HB 440"
    - For multiple bills, use a comma-separated list: "California's HB 440, New York's AB 123"
    - When mentioning a bill for the first time, use the full format: "California Assembly Bill 440 (CA HB 440)"
  • Use **Markdown formatting** for links, bullet points, tables, headings, and other formatting
  • IMPORTANT: Minimum **1000 words** and maximum **3000 words** for the "content" attribute
- Closing paragraph with neutral outlook analysis


**Image Prompts:**
The prompts for each image type are stored in the metadata section of the JSON output. Ensure each prompt is context-specific and relevant to the blog post content.

**SEO Elements:**
Keywords: [5-7 policy-specific terms]
Slug: [url-friendly-version-of-title]
Cluster ID: {cluster_id}

**Context Binding Protocols**
1. {TopSponsorCity} = Most frequent municipality in bill sponsorships
2. {PrimarySubgroupCode} = Highest impacted subgroup from cluster analysis
3. {MostAmendedPolicyTool} = Tool/mechanism in most revised bill section
4. {SponsorStateLandmark} = Geotagged landmark from primary sponsor district
5. {HearingTimeLighting} = Time-based lighting from committee hearing records
6. {Urban/RuralClassification} = Census-designated classification
7. {DemographicMarkerHandDetail} = Age/group-specific physical characteristics

**Important:**
- Cite bill numbers with state abbreviations and jurisdictions without partisan language
- The URL pattern for the cited bill detail page on the site is /{state_code_lowercase>/bill/{bill_id}
- Balance sponsored and non-sponsored perspectives using cluster statistics
- Highlight novel policy mechanisms from the legislation cluster
- Include 2-5 relevant historical precedents where applicable
- DO NOT MENTION THE WORD CLUSTER OR THE CLUSTER ID IN THE BLOG POST
- IMPORTANT: minimum 1000 words and maximum 3000 words for the "content" attribute
- Avoid using subgroup codes in the blog post. Use the subgroup names instead

^CRITICAL:^ Your response MUST be a valid JSON object EXACTLY matching this structure. Any deviation from this format, including additional fields, missing fields, or incorrect JSON syntax, will cause system failure. Do not include any explanatory text or markdown outside the JSON structure. The response should be parseable by JSON.parse() without any preprocessing.
